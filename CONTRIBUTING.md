# Reporting RhoGallery Mobile Issues

Found an issue with RhoGallery Mobile or want to give your feedback?  Here's how!


## Reporting issues

We only accept issues that are bug reports or feature requests. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within RhoGallery Mobile. If you're not sure or have other questions about customizing this application, please visit our [Launchpad Disscussion Area](https://developer.motorolasolutions.com/community/rhomobile-suite/rhomobile-community). Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. **Search for existing issues.** We sometimes get duplicate issues, and you'd help us out a lot by first checking if someone else has reported the same issue. Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved with a fix available.
2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case or scenario.** Be sure the problem exists in RhoGallery Mobile's code.
3. **Share as much information as possible.** Include platform and version you're working with, customized or vanilla build, etc. where appropriate. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.
